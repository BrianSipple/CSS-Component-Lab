[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/BrianSipple/segments.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
This project is set up to host random CSS experiments, cool view components, etc.

Self-contained markup and styles for each component are located within the /components directory. Right now, everything is simply linked to via index.html
